All-in-One Tools adds a new class of tools, all-in-one tools (henceforth known as AIOTs).

These handy bois function as a pickaxe and axe on left click (like the Picksaw) but can be swapped into a hammer on right click, and vice versa.
As a result, you are saved an additional hotbar slot for weapons and whatnot. Use your imagination.

Nine tiers of AIOT are added, from Copper tier all the way to Post-ML for Calamity.

In terms of progression, AIOTs are also a bit easier to get compared to the comparable vanilla tool so you can get past the monotony of mining a bit quicker.
Higher tier AIOTs also pack a punch and can be used as servicable weapons.

Gold tier AIOT can mine Meteorite [i/116]
Evil tier AIOT can mine Hellstone [i/174]
Hellstone tier AIOT can mine Cobalt/Palladium [i/364][i/1104]
Adamantite tier AIOT can mine Cryonic and Hallowed ores from Calamity [i/1225]
Hallowed tier AIOT can mine Chlorophyte [i/947]
Golem tier AIOT can mine Lihzahrd brick [i/1101]
Lunar tier AIOT can mine everything in the base game as well as Uelibloom ore from Calamity [i/3460]
Post-ML tier AIOT can mine Auric ore from Calamity.

Sprites are currently placeholders.
