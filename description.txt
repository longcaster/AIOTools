[c/00C5FF:All-in-One Tools adds a new class of tools, all-in-one tools (henceforth known as AIOTs).]

These handy bois function as a pickaxe and axe on left click (like the Picksaw) but can be swapped into a hammer on right click, and vice versa.
As a result, you are saved an additional hotbar slot for weapons and whatnot. Use your imagination.

Nine tiers of AIOT are added, from Copper tier all the way to Post-ML for Calamity.

In terms of progression, AIOTs are also a bit easier to get compared to the comparable vanilla tool so you can get past the monotony of mining a bit quicker.
Higher tier AIOTs also pack a punch and can be used as servicable weapons.

[c/FFD100:Gold tier] AIOTs can mine Meteorite [i/x:116]
[c/6400FF:Evil tier] AIOTs can mine Hellstone [i/x:174]
[c/FF4D00:Hellstone tier] AIOTs can mine Cobalt/Palladium [i/x:364][i/x:1104]
[c/FF0000:Adamantite tier] AIOTs can mine Cryonic and Hallowed ores from Calamity [i/x:1225]
[c/FFEA51:Hallowed tier] AIOTs can mine Chlorophyte [i/x:947]
[c/844A00:Golem tier] AIOTs can mine Lihzahrd brick [i/x:1101]
[c/44FFFEA:Lunar tier] AIOTs can mine everything in the base game as well as Uelibloom ore from Calamity [i/x:3460]
[c/44FFFEA:Post-ML tier] AIOTs can mine Auric ore from Calamity.

Sprites are currently placeholders.
