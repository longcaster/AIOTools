All-in-One Tools adds a new class of tools, all-in-one tools (henceforth known as AIOTs).

These handy bois function as a pickaxe and axe on left click (like the Picksaw or Pickaxe Axe) and as a hammer on right click.
As a result, you are saved an additional hotbar slot for weapons and whatnot. Use your imagination.

In terms of progression, AIOTs are also a bit easier to get compared to the comparable vanilla tool so you can get past the monotony of mining a bit quicker.

Inspired by the plethora of multipurpose tools in various Minecraft mods.
